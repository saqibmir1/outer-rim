## Establishing Communication Channels

*"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope."* - But actually, there are several ways to reach this rebel:

### üõ∏ **Primary Communication Arrays**

- **[Subspace Email](mailto:saqibmdmir@gmail.com)**: The most reliable way to send transmissions across the galaxy. Response time: Usually within one parsec.

- **[Telegram Beacon](https://t.me/sisyphusbutsus)**: For real-time communication when the Empire isn't monitoring channels. Status: 24/7 operational, even during Death Star attacks.

- **[Matrix Protocol](https://matrix.to/#/#prismcold:matrix.org)**: Encrypted rebel communications network. Currently on standby mode, but available for covert operations.

### üì° **Secondary Channels**

- **[Last.fm Music Database](https://www.last.fm/user/SisyphusButSus)**: Discover the cantina music that fuels my coding sessions. From Jizz to Electronic, all genres welcome.

- **IRC Frequency**: `sisypus @ libera.chat` - For old-school rebels who remember the ancient protocols.

### üîê **Secure Communications**

- **PGP Encryption Key**: [Download Imperial-Proof Encryption](saqib.gpg) - Because the Empire has been known to intercept unencrypted transmissions.
